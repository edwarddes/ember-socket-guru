### üìö Documentation

- Completely rewritten README with modern examples

- Updated examples to use ES6 class syntax
- Documented all Embroider compatibility improvements

### Migration from 1.x

If you're upgrading from ember-socket-guru 1.x:

1. **If you use Pusher, Phoenix, or Action Cable**: Stay on version 1.x or migrate to Socket.IO
2. **Update your service definition**:
   ```javascript
   // Before (1.x)
   export default SocketGuruService.extend({
     socketClient: 'socketio',
     config: { host: '...', namespace: '...' },
     observedChannels: ['event1', 'event2']
   });

   // After (2.x)
   export default class SocketService extends SocketGuruService {
     config = { host: '...', namespace: '...' };
     observedChannels = ['event1', 'event2'];
   }
   ```
3. **Remove `socketClient` property** - it's no longer needed
4. **Ensure `observedChannels` is an array** - object format is no longer supported
5. **Socket.IO server compatibility**: This version uses Socket.IO client v2.5.0 for backward compatibility with v2 servers. No server upgrade required.
6. **Update to Ember 4.0+** if you're on Ember 3.x
7. **Update to Node 14+** if you're on Node 12 or older
